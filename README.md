DSC
===

#### The official implementation of the Deformable Simplicial Complex (DSC) method in 3 dimensions.

The ability to virtually track deformable interfaces has many applications and is therefore of great interest. 
However, Eulerian methods, such as the level set method, tend to suffer from numerical 
difusion and Lagrangian methods are mostly not able to handle topology changes. This was the reason for 
developing a new method, the DSC method. The purpose of the DSC method is to be able to 
model the deformations of objects which are represented by an explicit representation of the interface. 
Furthermore, it is able to model large deformations and handle topology changes.
